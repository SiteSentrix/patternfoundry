  Draft garment patterns from body measurements, change the design, grade sizes, and print or
  export them at true scale. It runs natively on macOS, Windows, Linux and FreeBSD, and in the
  browser, and is written in pure Rust on top of the VectorCraft vector editor.

## Status
Early development (October 2026). PatternFoundry is VectorCraft renamed, with the pattern tools
still to come: see [`docs/plan.md`](docs/plan.md) for the milestones (pattern pieces, true-scale
printing, measurements, blocks, design tools, grading, cutting-room export) and
[`docs/market.md`](docs/market.md) for the features we aim to match and beat. There are no
downloads yet.

## Built on VectorCraft

PatternFoundry includes the full [VectorCraft](https://github.com/storytold/vectorcraft) editor:
pen, shape and brush tools, Pathfinder, type, gradients, live effects and artboards, and SVG, PDF,
EPS, DXF, EMF and raster files. Every action is an engine command, so agents can drive the app
over a JSON control channel and an MCP server the way a person does.

## Build and run

Rust 1.97 or newer.

```sh
cargo run --release -p vectorcraft                          # the app (the program is patternfoundry)
cargo run --release -p vectorcraft -- --control 7979        # + JSON control channel
cargo run --release -p vectorcraft-cli -- mcp               # MCP server (stdio)
cargo xtask ci                                              # fmt, clippy, tests, layering, wasm
```

See [`docs/development.md`](docs/development.md) for fonts, graphics processors, Wayland and other
platform notes.

## For contributors and agents
Start with [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) and [`docs/start-here.md`](docs/start-here.md); the editor's
own rules (clean-room, assets, no panics, quality gates) are in
[`docs/vectorcraft-CLAUDE.md`](docs/vectorcraft-CLAUDE.md) and [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

PatternFoundry is written clean-room: behaviour comes from public documentation only, never from
commercial pattern software.
