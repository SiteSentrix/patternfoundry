//! An avatar from body measurements (PF-10.1): the body the 3D fit preview drapes a pattern on.
//!
//! The body is lofted through horizontal cross-sections (rings) at the heights of the body's
//! landmarks: the base of the neck, the shoulders, the bust, the waist, the hips and the crotch on
//! the torso; the thigh, knee, calf and ankle on each leg; and the top of the arm, the upper arm,
//! the elbow and the wrist on each arm, the arms hanging a little out from the body (an A pose, as
//! fitting avatars stand, so a sleeve and the side of a bodice can hang between arm and body). Each ring is an ellipse as round as the body is
//! there (its depth over its breadth) and exactly as long round as the girth measured, so a
//! garment drafted from the same measurements meets the body where the tape went.
//!
//! Proportions the measurements don't give come from the U.S. Army's ANSUR II survey of 1,986
//! women (2012, public data:
//! <https://ph.health.mil/topics/workplacehealth/ergo/Pages/Anthropometric-Database.aspx>), its
//! means: the chest 0.918 as deep as it is broad, the waist 0.709, the hips (buttock depth over
//! hip breadth) 0.658; the heights of the bust (chest height), waist (omphalion), knee and ankle
//! above the floor, the cervicale's above the waist and the crotch's below the buttocks; the thigh 0.603 of the hips round,
//! the knee (lower thigh) 0.392, the calf 0.366, the ankle 0.212, the base of the neck 0.394 of the
//! chest; the shoulders (acromion) 60.6 mm and the armpit (axilla) 156.7 below the cervicale, the
//! shoulders 365.3 broad (biacromial breadth), 0.386 of the chest round, and as deep at the shoulders
//! as their 1028.2 round over the deltoids at 450.3 across makes them (0.476 of their breadth); the
//! arm 543.6 from the shoulder to the wrist (sleeve outseam), the elbow 311.2 down it
//! (acromion–radiale); the upper arm (biceps) 0.323 of the chest round, the forearm 0.864 of the
//! upper arm and the wrist 0.506 (the means of the survey's women, computed from its public data).
//! A male figure ([`Figure::Male`], PF-10.11) takes the same proportions from the survey's 4,082
//! men instead (in [`MEN`]: a chest 0.877 as deep as broad, hips 0.711, broader shoulders, longer
//! arms, all heights taller), and has no bust standing forward: its chest (the `bust`
//! measurement, taken round the chest) is one elliptic ring. A child ([`Figure::Child`], PF-10.13)
//! takes them from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's 1977 survey of 3,900 children from
//! 2 to 18 (public domain), by age band, the band chosen by the chest's girth ([`CHILD_BANDS`]).
//! All lengths are in mm, x across the body (to its left), y to its front, z up from the
//! floor.
