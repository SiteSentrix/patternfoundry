//! # PatternFoundry pattern core
//!
//! What makes a path a sewing-pattern piece, and the geometry drawn from it. Nothing here knows the
//! vector editor: the host flattens a piece's seam line into an [`Outline`] and draws the marks.
//!
//! * [`piece`] – the data a piece carries ([`Piece`]): name, cut count, fabric, seam allowance per
//!   edge, corner styles, notches, grainline; and [`PatternTag`], how the host marks the parts of a
//!   piece it draws.
//! * [`allowance`] – the cutting line: the seam line pushed out by each edge's allowance, with
//!   mitred or squared corners.
//! * [`marks`] – notches, the grainline arrow and the label text.
//! * [`measure`] – measurement sets (in mm, with formulas over them) and size charts; [`expr`]
//!   the formulas' small language; [`draft`] – path points placed by formulas, so a draft
//!   follows the measurements.
//! * [`block`] – blocks drafted from the measurements (the close-fitting bodice, the straight
//!   skirt, the one-piece sleeve, the trousers).
//! * [`design`] – design tools on an outline: pivot a dart elsewhere, split a piece in two.
//! * [`grade`] – grade rules: how a piece's points move from size to size.
//! * [`marker`] – marker making: every piece to cut laid on the fabric's width, closely.
//! * [`tiling`] – what a printed page of a tiled pattern carries: its name, overlap lines and the
//!   10 cm and 1 in test squares.
//!
//! **Units.** Allowances and mark sizes are stored in millimetres, the unit sewists measure in
//! (true scale is exact: [`MM_PER_PT`] is the definition, not a rounding). Positions (the
//! grainline's ends) are in the host document's coordinates, so they move with the piece. The
//! geometry functions take every length in the outline's own unit; the host converts.
