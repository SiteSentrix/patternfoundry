//! # PatternFoundry AI
//!
//! What PatternFoundry asks an AI model for, and how its replies are read. The model is Claude,
//! reached through the Messages API with the user's own API key, or through the Foundry cloud
//! service paid in Foundry credits ([`cloud`]). No network code lives here: the app sends the
//! [`HttpRequest`]s built here with its own client and hands the answers back to be read.
//!
//! * [`ask`] – Ask About Patterns: questions about sewing patterns and PatternFoundry, answered
//!   by Claude, which can look at the pattern open now and, with the user's leave, change it
//!   through PatternFoundry's commands.
//! * [`muslin`] – Check My Muslin: photos of a muslin (a test garment) tried on, looked at by
//!   Claude for fit, which says what to alter and, with the user's leave, alters the pattern.
//! * [`cloud`] – Foundry accounts: signing in, the credits, and AI requests sent through the
//!   service.
//!
//! Adapted from StitchFoundry's AI client (`crates/sf-core/src/ai.rs` in
//! github.com/Stitchwright/StitchFoundry, the same owner and licence), as `docs/start-here.md`
//! plans.
//!
//! Body measurements are personal data: nothing here sends them by itself; a request carries
//! only what the app puts in it.
